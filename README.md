# NSS - Overly Excited JavaScript Exercise
Implementing initial practices of for loops, conditional statements, string concatenation, arithmetic operators, and console logging

## Stacking Words 
#### first section - commented out
Create an array with all the words in the following sentence

> The walrus danced through the trees in the light of the moon

Loop through the sentence and incrementally add each word to a new console.log until the sentence is complete:

> The   
> The walrus    
> The walrus danced      
> The walrus danced through     
> The walrus danced through the     
> The walrus danced through the trees         
> The walrus danced through the trees in            
> The walrus danced through the trees in the        
> The walrus danced through the trees in the light  
> The walrus danced through the trees in the light of   
> The walrus danced through the trees in the light of the    
> The walrus danced through the trees in the light of the moon 

## Adding Conditions
#### second section - commented out
Utilize condtional statments to add a single exclamation point to every 3rd word in the sentence:
 
> The               
> The walrus            
> The walrus danced!                
> The walrus danced! through            
> The walrus danced! through the            
> The walrus danced! through the trees!         
> The walrus danced! through the trees! in          
> The walrus danced! through the trees! in the          
> The walrus danced! through the trees! in the light!           
> The walrus danced! through the trees! in the light! of            
> The walrus danced! through the trees! in the light! of the        
> The walrus danced! through the trees! in the light! of the moon!   

## Operand Challenge
Increase the number of exclamation points after every thrid word by how many times the counter variable can be divided by 3. Expected output:

> The                   
> The walrus            
> The walrus danced!            
> The walrus danced! through            
> The walrus danced! through the            
> The walrus danced! through the trees!!            
> The walrus danced! through the trees!! in         
> The walrus danced! through the trees!! in the             
> The walrus danced! through the trees!! in the light!!!            
> The walrus danced! through the trees!! in the light!!! of             
> The walrus danced! through the trees!! in the light!!! of the             
> The walrus danced! through the trees!! in the light!!! of the moon!!!!
